            <p>6. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</p>

            <p>
              In Short: If you choose to register or log in to our services
              using a social media account, we may have access to certain
              information about you.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our Website offers you the ability to register and login using
              your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook
              or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive
              certain profile information about you from your social media
              provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on
              the social media provider concerned, but will often include your
              name, email address, friends list, profile picture as well as
              other information you choose to make public on such social media
              platform.
            </p>

            <p>
              We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that
              are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made
              clear to you on the relevant Website. Please note that we do not
              control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal
              information by your third-party social media provider. We
              recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how
              they collect, use and share your personal information, and how you
              can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps. 7. WHAT
              IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?
            </p>

            <p>
              In Short: We are not responsible for the safety of any information
              that you share with third-party providers who advertise, but are
              not affiliated with, our Website.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Website may contain advertisements from third parties that are
              not affiliated with us and which may link to other websites,
              online services or mobile applications. We cannot guarantee the
              safety and privacy of data you provide to any third parties. Any
              data collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy
              notice. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and
              security practices and policies of any third parties, including
              other websites, services or applications that may be linked to or
              from the Website. You should review the policies of such third
              parties and contact them directly to respond to your questions.
            </p>

            <p>8. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</p>

            <p>
              In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to
              fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless
              otherwise required by law.
            </p>

            <p>
              We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
              necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless
              a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as
              tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this
              notice will require us keeping your personal information for
              longer than the period of time in which users have an account with
              us.
            </p>

            <p>
              When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
              personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
              information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because
              your personal information has been stored in backup archives),
              then we will securely store your personal information and isolate
              it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
            </p>

            <p>9. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</p>

            <p>
              In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a
              system of organizational and technical security measures.
            </p>

            <p>
              We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational
              security measures designed to protect the security of any personal
              information we process. However, despite our safeguards and
              efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission
              over the Internet or information storage technology can be
              guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee
              that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties
              will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect,
              access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our
              best to protect your personal information, transmission of
              personal information to and from our Website is at your own risk.
              You should only access the Website within a secure environment.
            </p>

            <p>10. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</p>

            <p>
              In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to
              children under 18 years of age.
            </p>

            <p>
              We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under
              18 years of age. By using the Website, you represent that you are
              at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor
              and consent to such minor dependent&rsquo;s use of the Website. If
              we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years
              of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take
              reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records.
              If you become aware of any data we may have collected from
              children under age 18, please contact us at
              yichenzhu1337@gmail.com.

              are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have

              Terms of Use and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.

              Opting out of email marketing: You can unsubscribe from our
              marketing email list at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe
              link in the emails that we send or by contacting us using the
              details provided below. You will then be removed from the
              marketing email list &mdash; however, we may still communicate
              with you, for example to send you service-related emails that are
              necessary for the administration and use of your account, to
              respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.
              To otherwise opt-out, you may: Access your account settings and
              update your preferences.

            <p>12. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</p>

            <p>
              Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
              applications include a Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or
              setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to
              have data about your online browsing activities monitored and
              collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for
              recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As
              such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any
              other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to
              be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
              that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
              practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
