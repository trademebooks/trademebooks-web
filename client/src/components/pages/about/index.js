              <h3>Our Story</h3>
              <p>
                The summer of 2013, Cedric Mosdell had just finished his first year of engineering school at McMaster University. He wanted to sell his old textbooks and notes from the previous year, but found the other platforms at the time like Facebook Groups, Craigslist, and Kijiji all too clunky and user-unfriendly. He found that those platforms were not only hard to post books to sell, they were also hard to search for specific books to buy.
                
                Cedric searched online for platforms to buy and sell his textbooks and eventually found http://tusbe.com/. Unfortunately, tusbe was only for Toronto-based universities and colleges like UofT, Ryerson, and York.

                On one hot summer day, Cedric and Yichen had a friendly game of ping pong, when Cedric realized that Yichen went to UofT - so he told him about the problem.

                Cedric: "I've been trying to buy used textbooks and could never find the best one with the cheapest price, even when I do find it, the quality of the book is way below what the person listed"

                Yichen: "Yeah, that's why you should just use tubse.com!"

                Cedric: "I would, but I go to McMaster!"

                Yichen: "Oh, right... well... sucks to be you I guess"

                Cedric: "I know! Why don't we get create our own version of tusbe, let's call it musbe!"

                Yichen: "What's in it for me?"

                Cedric: "You can put it on your resume, and I'll teach you how to play ping pong"

                Yichen: "Deal!"

                And so began the long journey of creating musbe.ca.

                On August 23rd, 2014, on the day of Yichen's birthday, Cedric and Yichen would launch musbe.ca.

                The 2 posted to about a dozen McMaster-based Facebook groups and told all of their old high school friends of the new book exchange website that they created for McMaster students.
                
                Within the first hour, over 100 students had signed up and over 200 listings were posted. And within the first day, over 1000 users had signed up.

                Ever since that moment, Cedric and Yichen vowed to create musbe 2.0.

                The next was to expand musbe to other diferent sschools, and hence trademebooks was created.
